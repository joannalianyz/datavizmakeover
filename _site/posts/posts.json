Hence, the intention of the visualisation is unclear to individuals looking at the visualisation. Is the purpose of the visualisation to see if a trading market has a higher volume of imports or exports? Or is the purpose to see how the total merchandise trade volume differs across these ten markets?\r\nWith the absence of a title, individuals would also have no clue about the timeframe of the data, i.e. is the data indicative of trade value at a particular point of time or is the data indicative of cumulative trade value for a certain time period? Also, are we trying to observe the trade trends over time or are only interested in total trade performance for the entire time period, i.e., considering only the total trade volume for the entire ten years from January 2011 to December 2020.\r\nBesides that, there are only ten data points indicated on the visualisation. Was there a particular reason why the data for these markets/countries were chosen to be displayed? If yes, why? Individuals would have to try to interpret what the visualisation is trying to show from any other annotations or notes on the visualisation.\r\nIt is unclear if the visualisation is looking at market/country level data or at region level data. One assumption we may make is that this visualisation is focusing on the top ten trading markets from the data source. After we clean up the data source, we see that the top ten trading markets (summing up both imports and exports) are Asia, Europe, Mainland China, America, Malaysia, European Union (EU) United States, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\r\nThese markets tally with most, but not all of the data points in the visualisation. Furthermore, we note that the visualisation has data for the EU (which is an economic union of various countries in Europe like France, Germany etc) reflected in the visualisation but all other data points reflect market/country level data. If we look at the data source, we see that data for the individual countries (France, Germany, Belgium etc.) which make up the EU can be found as well. This again makes the intention of the visualisation more unclear as the EU (which is a cluster of countries) would naturally and obviously have a higher volume of trade than the individual member countries. The same can be observed for America and the United States where the United States is a part of America.\r\nWith the above said, it is difficult to know if the visualisation is focusing on market/country level data or region level data.\r\nBoth axes of the visualisation have no units. While the data points in the visualisation have values associated with them (measured in S$ billions), it would be much clearer if there was proper indication of the unit of measurement for both axis.\r\nThere is a note at the bottom of the visualisation which talks about how the value of exports exceeds imports for Singapore’s merchandise trade with Mainland China from 2009 while the opposite is true of Singapore’s merchandise trade with United States since 2006. While this is an interesting piece of information to note, such details cannot be inferred from the visualisation and hence, there is no way for individuals to verify this piece of information.\r\n\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nThere is poor and excessive use of colours in the visualisation. This makes it difficult to focus on the visualisation. If we want objects in a visualisation to be easily seen, we should use a background colour that contrasts sufficiently with the objects. However, in this case, even though the background of the visualisation is blue, there are still so many other blue toned objects.\r\nWhile there is a note to explain what the size of the bubbles indicate and the significance of the location where the centre points lies, it is difficult to see where the centre points lie exactly for certain points due to the opacity of the bubbles.\r\nThere is so much overlapping between the data points that some of the centre points are totally blocked: the centre points for the Republic of Korea and the EU are totally blocked. Viewers cannot even tell whether the centre points lie in the blue or green region.\r\n\r\nTick marks and clear inkings are necessary on continuous scale for clarity but there is none for this visualisation.\r\n2.0 Alternative Design\r\nThe proposed design is as follows:\r\n\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nWe utilise 2 charts - an animated bubble plot and a line graph with a filter to convey the necessary information.\r\nThe bubble plot will show how each country’s total trade volume, percentage of imports and percentage of exports change over time from January 2011 to December 2020.\r\nThe line graph will show the total trend for import and export volume over time from January 2011 to December 2020.\r\n\r\nWe will include a title in our proposed visualisation to make the intent of our visualisation clear. We will also include a summary to further explain what information our visualisation is conveying.\r\nWe will look solely at market/country level data to create a fair ground for comparison. More specifically, we will be looking at the import and export volumes for the top 10 trading markets/countries (ranking based on cumulative import and export volumes from January 2011 to December 2020). This intent will indicated clearly in the title.\r\nFor clarity, we will include units on both the X-axis and Y-axis as and when necessary..\r\n2.2 Aesthetic\r\nOur bubble plot will have a reduced opacity to ensure that overlapping bubbles can still be seen.\r\nWe will use a simple white background for both the bubble plot and line graph to help contrast against any other colour on the both charts.\r\nWe will include tick marks on our axes and ensure that our charts are clearly inked.\r\n3.0 Proposed Visualisation\r\nPlease view the proposed visualisation on Tableau Public here.\r\n4.0 Step-by-step Guide\r\nWe will provide a step-by-step guide on how to create our proposed alternative data visualisation.\r\nData Sources\r\nThe datasets used for this data visualisation were extracted from singstat. Specifically, they can be found under the following sections:\r\nMerchandise Imports By Region/Market, Monthly\r\nMerchandise Exports By Region/Market, Monthly\r\nData Preparation\r\nScreenshots of the raw dataset are as shown below:\r\n\r\nIt is noted that we do not need many of the data present in the raw dataset and also, there is some other data that we need but are not available in the dataset. Hence, we will conduct some transformation of the data.\r\nThe data transformation steps (done in Microsoft Excel) are as follows:\r\nFor both tables, we removed data from January 1976 to December 2010 and from January 2021 to April 2021. We also removed the data which represent regional values – rows 8 to 13 in the raw datasets. This is because we are interested only in country-level data for this visualisation.\r\nWe created a new table which indicates total merchandise trade volume, i.e. the sum of exports and imports, for each market for each month from January 2011 to December 2020. In this new table, we add a column at the far end to sum up the total trade for each market for the entire time period from January 2011 to December 2020.\r\n\r\nNext, using the total merchandise trade volume table, we ranked the markets according to the total trade conducted between January 2011 to December 2020. We are only interested in the top ten markets which are in order – Mainland China, Malaysia, United States, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Republic of Korea, Thailand and India.\r\nLastly, we cleaned up and reformatted the data with the categories: month, country, import, export and total to make it easier to use on Tableau.\r\nThe transformed dataset is shown below:\r\n\r\nThis dataset is then uploaded into Tableau.\r\nWe will now create our visualisation which is an interactive and animated dashboard consisting of a bubble plot and a line graph.\r\n4.1 Bubble Plot\r\nFirstly, we use an animated bubble plot to illustrate how total trade volume and import/export percentages change during the time period from January 2011 to December 2020 for the top ten markets.\r\nWe create 4 new calculated fields under the Analysis tab.\r\nExports\r\n\r\nImports\r\n\r\nExports %\r\n\r\nImports %\r\n\r\nDrag Exports % from Measures to Columns and Imports % from Measures to Rows. By default, the aggregate of both measures is taken.\r\n\r\nNext we drag Country to Color.\r\n\r\nWe change the format of the marks from ‘Automatic’ to ‘Circle’.\r\n\r\nNext, we edit the format of the Y-axis to reflect percentages(%). We do the same for the X-axis.\r\n\r\nWe drag Total to Size. The size of the bubble will be directly proportionate to the volume of trade.\r\n\r\nWe add a border and increase the size of the bubbles to improve the aesthetics of the bubble plot. We also reduce the opacity of the bubbles.\r\n\r\nWe now want to edit the tool tips.\r\n\r\nWe drag Import, Export, Total and Country to Tooltip.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe below is the new tooltip.\r\n\r\nWe drag Month to Pages and select the Month of Month. We turn on the animation on the Analysis tab.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe edit the title of the bubble plot.\r\n\r\nThe below is the end result.\r\n\r\n4.2 Line Graph\r\nWe now create a line graph with a filter to illustrate the trend for imports and exports from January 2011 to December 2020.\r\nDrag Month from Dimensions to Columns and Export and Import from Measures to Rows. By default, the sum of of the two measures is taken.\r\n\r\nWe right-click on Import and select ‘Dual Axis’. We make sure to synchronise the axis.\r\n\r\nWe expand the ‘Year’ of Month to include ‘Month’ of Month and select ‘Entire View’ to view entrire graph at a glance.\r\n\r\nClick on Color and change the line type to one with markers.\r\n\r\nAs before, we edt the title and the axes accordingly. For both of the Y-axis, we unselect the ‘Include Zero’ button.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast but not least, we drag Country to Filter. We select ‘Show Filter’.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want to show the filter as a single list.\r\n\r\nThis is the end product.\r\n\r\n4.4 Dashboard\r\nWe create an animated and interactive dashboard which combines the bubble plot and the line graph which we have created.\r\n\r\n4.5 Story\r\nAs a final step, we create a story on Tableau using the dashboard that we have created. We drag the dashboard that we have created to the story and add in an appropriate title and caption.\r\n\r\n5.0 Three major observations\r\nAmongst these ten markets, we see from our bubble plot that the proportion of imports and exports for Taiwan, Indonesia and Hong Kong are the most consistent, i.e. the volume of imports is consistently higher than the volume of exports when considering Singapore’s trade relationship with Taiwan while the opposite is true for Singapore’s trade relationship with Indonesia and Hong Kong.\r\nFor all other markets, we see that the import % and export % fluctuate quite a bit. Some related observations include the interesting occurrence of the % changes for the United States where the volume of imports exceeded the volume of exports for the first time during this time period in April 2020.\r\n\r\nWe can clearly see the growth and development of Singapore’s trade relationship with Mainland China’s through our visualisation. Total trade volume grew from SGD$8.8B in January 2011 to SGD$13.3B in December 2020. Both the volume of imports and exports have increased but definitely, the growth in the volume of exports has outpaced the growth in imports.\r\n\r\nAs a totality, the export and import trends with these top ten trading markets do rise and fall together. We also see that as a totality, Singapore’s export volume with these top ten trading markets are consistently higher than its imports.\r\nAs a highly developed economy, Singapore’s main exports include electrical machinery and equipment, machinery including computers,mineral fuels including oil and optical, technical, medical apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1. Critique of the Visualisation\r\nThis is the original visualisation.\r\n\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\nThe title of the visualisation, ‘Merchandise Trade of Top Six Trading Countries, 2019-2020’, is vague and unclear. While readers might expect to see a graph comparing the overall merchandise trade volume across the top six trading countries from 2019 to 2020, the original visualisation is instead showing us the import and export volumes in each of the six countries from 2019 to 2020.\r\nFollowing up with point 1, the title does not indicate if the trade volume is measured in dollars or in units. The Y-axis has no units too. If the trade volume is indeed measured in dollars, it is unclear what currency is used as the basis for measurement. While these two datasets come from a Singapore-governed website, the source is not explicitly stated on the graph and hence, it will not be immediately obvious to anyone looking at the visualisation that the measurement is in SGD$. The unit of measurement should be indicated in the visualisation and there should be a caption indicating the data source.\r\nWith a title that indicates a ranking (top six), individuals would expect to see a clear ranking of these six countries. However, there is no clear ranking indicated in this visualisation.\r\nThe title of the visualisation would lead individuals to expect to see data from 2019 to 2020. However, the visualisation for Japan only has 2020 data.\r\nThe visualisation for each of the six countries has a different Y-axis scale and the difference in scale across the is not conveyed properly. Thus, it is hard to make comparisons of the data presented in the visualisations.\r\nThe title of the X-axis is ‘Month of Period’ but the labels on the X-axis indicate the year instead of the month.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nThere is poor use of colours in the chart. The overlapping of colours make it extremely hard to compare import and export trends for each country.\r\nThe layout of the chart makes it difficult to infer any comparisons or observations across countries.\r\nThe size of the six charts are all different. For example, the chart for Mainland China is much wider than the rest while the chart for Japan is much narrower than the rest.\r\n2.0 Alternative Design\r\nThe proposed design is as follows.It will be a dashboard consisting of a faceted line graph, a bar chart and a line graph.\r\n\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nWe utilise 3 charts - a faceted line graph (main chart), a bar chart and a line graph to convey the necessary information.\r\nThe faceted line graph will show the trend in exports and imports in the six countries throughout 2019 to 2020.\r\nThe bar chart will show the overal volume of merchandise trade in the six countries for the entire time period from 2019 to 2020.\r\nThe line graph will show the trend in overall merchandise trade volume in the six countries throughout 2019 to 2020.\r\n\r\nWe will include clear titles for each of the charts. For the main chart, we will also add in a subtitle to explain the intention of our visualisation clearly.\r\nMain chart - Faceted line graph\r\nTitle: Insight into Merchandise Trade Volume (SGD$) of Top Six Trading Countries, 2019 - 2020\r\nSubtitle: A comparison of import and export trends within each country and across countries\r\n\r\nBar chart\r\nTitle: Total Merchandise Trade Volume (SGD$) of Top Six Trading Countries, 2019 - 2020\r\n\r\nLine graph\r\nTitle: Total Merchandise Trade Volume (SGD$) Trend, 2019 - 2020\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will include a caption to indicate the source of the data.\r\nThe unit of measurement will added to the title and the Y-axis of all three charts to make it clear that the trade volume is measured in SGD$.\r\nFor easy comparison, we will utilise a dual axis and align the Y-axis scale in the faceted line graph.\r\nWe will scale the X-axis to the month of year.\r\n2.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe layout, the Y-axis scale and the X-axis scale of the visualization will be amended to make it easier to form comparisons and observations.\r\nWe will use line graphs instead of area charts so that there will be no overlapping of colours which make the visualisation confusing.\r\nWe will ensure that all charts are of the same size.\r\n3.0 Proposed Visualisation\r\nPlease view the visualisation on Tableau Public here.\r\n4.0 Step-by-step Guide\r\nWe will provide a step-by-step guide on how to create our proposed alternative static data visualisation.\r\nData Sources\r\nThe datasets used for this data visualisation were extracted from singstat. Specifically, they can be found under the following sections:\r\nMerchandise Imports By Region/Market, Monthly\r\nMerchandise Exports By Region/Market, Monthly\r\nData Preparation\r\nScreenshots of the raw dataset are as shown below:\r\n\r\nIt is noted that we do not need many of the data present in the raw dataset and also, there is some other data that we need but are not available in the dataset. Hence, we will conduct some transformation of the data.\r\nThe data transformation steps (done in Microsoft Excel) are as follows:\r\nFor both tables, we removed data from January 1976 to December 2018 and from January 2021 to April 2021. We also removed the data which represent regional values – rows 8 to 13 in the raw datasets. This is because we are interested only in country-level data for this visualisation.\r\nWe created a new table, Total Merchandise Volume, which indicates total merchandise trade volume, i.e. the sum of exports and imports, for each country for each month from January 2019 to December 2020. In this new table, we added a column at the far end to indicate total trade for each country for the entire time period from January 2019 to December 2020.\r\n\r\nNext, using the Total Merchandise Volume table, we ranked the countries according to the total trade conducted between January 2019 to December 2020. We are only interested in the top six countries which are in order – Mainland China, Malaysia, United States, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia.\r\n\r\nLastly, we cleaned up and reformatted the data in the Total Merchandise Volume table into a new table called CleanData by extracting only the data for the top six countries and reformatting the data to make it easier to use on Tableau.\r\nThe transformed dataset is shown below:\r\n\r\nThis dataset is then uploaded into Tableau.\r\nWe will now create our visualisations consisting of a bar chart, a line graph and a faceted line graph which we will combine together to form a storyboard which will be our final visualisation.\r\n4.1 Bar Chart\r\nFirstly, we use a bar chart to illustrate the ranking of the total merchandise trade volume during the time period from January 2019 to December 2020 for the top six countries.\r\nDrag Country from Dimensions to Rows and Total from Measures to Columns. By default, the sum of Total is taken.\r\n\r\nBy double clicking on the title of the bar chart, we amend the title of the bar chart to ‘Total Merchandise Trade Volume (SGD$) of Top Six Trading Countries from 2019 -2020’.\r\n\r\nNext, we right-click on one of the bars in the bar chart, select Mark Label and click Annotate. The corresponding value for the bar will then appear on the chart. We repeat this step for all the bars.\r\n\r\nNow, we want to add a caption to indicate the data source. We right-click on any spot just outside the chart and select Caption.\r\n\r\nWe add in the following caption:\r\n\r\nWe change the colour of the bars to a dark grey.\r\n\r\nThis is our final end-product. We call this sheet ‘Total MTV’.\r\n\r\n4.2 Line Graph\r\nWe now create a line graph to observe the trend in total merchandise trade volume in each of the six countries from January 2019 to December 2020.\r\nDrag Month from Dimensions to Columns and Total from Measures to Rows. By default, the sum of Total is taken. We want both the year and month component of Month to be displayed,\r\n\r\nDrag Country to colour.\r\n\r\nWe edit the label of the Y-axis to ‘Total Merchandise Trade Volume (SGD$)’ to make the intention of the line graph clearer.\r\n\r\nSimilar to before, we amend the title and we add in a caption to indicate the data source as well. This is the end product. We call this sheet ‘Total MTV Trend’.\r\n\r\n4.3 Faceted line graph\r\nWe now create a faceted line graph to observe the trend of imports and exports in each of the six countries from January 2019 to December 2020\r\nDrag Month from Dimensions to Columns (both year and month components displayed), Country from Dimensions to Rows and Exports and Imports from Measures to Rows. The sum of Exports and the sum of Imports are taken.\r\n\r\nUsing the same steps as we did before, We amend the Y-axis labels to Exports(SGD) and Imports(SGD) accordingly, update the title/subtitle and we add in a caption to indicate the data source as well.\r\n\r\nWe create a dual axis by right clicking on SUM(Imports) and selecting Dual Axis.\r\n\r\nWe edit the colour of the line graphs to make the colours contrast and stand out more.\r\n\r\nThis is the end-product. We call this sheet ‘MTV (Imp&Exp)’.\r\n\r\n4.4 Dashboard\r\nWe create a static dashboard which combines the bar chart, line graph and faceted line graph which we have created.\r\n\r\n4.5 Story\r\nAs a final step, we create a story on Tableau using the dashboard that we have created. We drag the dashboard that we have created to the story,\r\n\r\nAfter which, we add in a caption to explain the objective of the visualisation.\r\n\r\n5.0 Three major observations\r\nFor the top three countries – Mainland China, Malaysia and the United States, the volume of imports and exports for each of these countries is similar. This is in contrast to the next three countries – Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia where the volume of imports and exports for each of these countries is very different. For example, the volume of imports into Taiwan is far higher than the volume of exports. In contrast, for Hong Kong and Indonesia, the volume of exports is far higher than the volume of imports. Such differences highlight the differences in characteristics between these six economies and it will be interesting to deep-dive into the main industries which encompass these countries’ trade.\r\nFluctuations in trade volume were more pronounced in 2020 than in 2019. This is likely due to the covid-19 pandemic. In the first six months of 2020, we observe that these top six countries largely saw a sharp decrease in trade volume as the pandemic led to border closures all around the world.\r\nLooking at the overall merchandise trade volume trend for the six countries, we can observe that apart from Mainland China which experienced growth in trade volume, the other five countries’ trade volume did not grow much from January 2019 to December 2020. This was largely due to China being able to recover its economy much faster than other countries during the covid-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
